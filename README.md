TO MAKE A PURCHASE:
Under the table, the user will be shown the first question: "Select the item you'd like to purchase" along with a list of all available items to purchase. To select an item, simply scrow down using the down arrow key until the desired product is hightlighted, then hit 'enter'.

The next question, "Indicate how many of this product you'd like to purchase:" will then be shown. User is to enter the desired quantity of the said item they'd like to purchase.

PURCHASE CALCULATIONS:
If it is shown that there is sufficent inventory to cover the desired quantity, the user will then be shown the final cost for the purchase, along with the updated inventory number of the item they just purchased from the store.

However, if there ISN'T sufficent inventory to cover the desired quantity, the user will then be shown, "Insufficient quantity! Try again" and then redirected to the "open" or start of the app, complete with the table and the first prompt: ""Select the item you'd like to purchase".

Happy shopping! Be sure to leave some Valium for me.  ;)
